# Quiz-Challange

Module 4 Challenge
This weeks challenge was to build a quiz off the 4th Module. I ended up having to restart my entire project due to the fact I was having an issue with the git commands but ended up fixing it later on down the line.
In order to make the project work since we had two links one to the acutal quiz and one to the high scores i created a separate HTML and JS to make it a bit more user friendly and easier to use.
